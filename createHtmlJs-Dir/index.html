            Methods that have special treatment for empty slots include the following: concat(), copyWithin(), every(), filter(), flat(), flatMap(), forEach(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), map(), reduce(), reduceRight(), reverse(), slice(), some(), sort(), and splice(). Iteration methods such as forEach don't visit empty slots at all. Other methods, such as concat, copyWithin, etc., preserve empty slots when doing the copying, so in the end the array is still sparse.

            Tasks, that I can do:
            Take this string of words, for ex., "concat(), copyWithin(), every(), filter(), flat(), flatMap(), forEach(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), map(), reduce(), reduceRight(), reverse(), slice(), some(), sort(), and splice()", and for each word, wrap a double or single quotation mark on it. 

            What I can do is take this sting; split it at each comma-"," and append each into a list, if a list has not been created and appended to already. Remove leading and trailing spaces of ea. item of list(/ array), and finally add a double/single quotation in front of item and end of item. 

            Steps to take:
            Find function/method for splitting arrays in Js
            function/method for stripping spaces for text in Js
